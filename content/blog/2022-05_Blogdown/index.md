I have been using R over four years. At the beginning, I have not thought to create a website with R but people can know that R is more than statistical language and you would be addicted to R in a short time. :smile: In this blog, I will provide some books, links, and videos that might be beneficial for people who want to create website by using R markdown. 

First things first. R markdown documents provide an opportunity to create quick, efficient, and reproducible documents by using R. You might produce MS Word, PDF or HTML output with R markdown. For more information, you may want to check these websites and books.

- [**R Markdown Cookbook**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)

If you are familiar with R markdown, you might want to focus on blogdown package that helps to create static website. To install blogdown, you should write on your console:


```r
install.packages("blogdown", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

library(blogdown)
```

After installing packages, you should check these links that are perfect for beginners and intermediate level blogdown users.

- [**blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)

Being advanced user might take time in R markdown as well as blogdown. But, this is not an obstacle for you to create website with blogdown. Some R users and theme developers have amazing tutorials that explain every single steps before publishing your website. For me, [Alison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com/)'s amazing recordings have helped me to develop my personal website you should watch her recordings on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQYM-t2ut2zXr4d7TIFya1A). Especially, This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AADnslLpzJ4) is more helpful for beginners because they build a website from beginning to the end. 

In this blog, I have provided several links, books, and videos but this will not be the last post. I am planning to record a video that explains how to create a website by using R for beginners. See you soon! :wave:
