### **Lecturer (2022 - )**

#####  Social Movement and Protest (PLSC 486Z)

This class will help to explore scholarship from comparative politics, international relations, and political sociology that focuses on the development of social movements and the outcomes that they produce. As we connect history, theory, and scholarship to contemporary politics, key questions will include: How do social movements mobilize under different regime types? Does state repression deter contentious collective action? When do protests lead to political change? By the end of this course, you should have a good understanding of the major theoretical debates about social movements and protests and cursory knowledge of several different social movements and protests in several countries such as the United States, China, Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, Turkey, Mexico, etc. + [**Syllabus** :crayon:](http://desiree.rbind.io/)
